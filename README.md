# Crystal-Game
The Crystal Game is a game of skill and mathematics. 

## Game Play
When a user begins the game, a random number is displayed. Each crystal also receives a random value. The goal is to use the crystals to reach a total that matches the random number shown. Clicking the crystals adds to your total score. The game ends when a user matches the random number (a winner!!) or exceeds the random number (loser...). The game automatically resets and assigns a new random number and new random values to the crystals.

## Getting Started
It's very simple. To run the code, download the repository zip file and open in your browser.

## Built With
* [Bootstrap V3](http://bootstrapdocs.com/v3.0.3/docs/) - CSS framework
* [jQuery API](http://api.jquery.com/)

## Future Enhancements
In the future, I'd love to make a two player option. The turns would be timed so that each player is forced to make quick mathematical decisions twith a goal of reaching, but not exceeding, the random number before their opponent.

## Collaboration
I am very open to contributions! Please feel free to create an issue if you'd like to take on the two player enhancement or have any other ideas or suggestions that could improve this game.
